## Installation

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Go to `example`

Copy and edit `.env.example`

```bash
cd example
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Export environment variables and use `setup.sh` to create `database.ini` and set permissions

```bash
cd example
source .env
bash setup.sh
```

If you want to start a local development instance, use `docker-compose.dev.yml`.

```bash
cd example
docker-compose --file docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

## Usage

Start Omeka S

```bash
cd example
docker-compose up -d
```

If your installation complains about not being able to write to the folder `files`, fix permissions accordingly.

```bash
cd example
chown -R www-data:www-data files logs modules themes
```

If you run your installation in production edit `example/Dockerfile accordingly.

```yaml
FROM openmuseum/omeka-s

COPY ./config/.htaccess-production /usr/src/omeka-s/.htaccess
COPY ./config/database.ini /usr/src/omeka-s/config/database.ini
COPY ./config/local.config-production.php /usr/src/omeka-s/config/local.config.php
COPY ./config/php-production.ini /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini
RUN service apache2 restart
```

Stop Omeka S

```bash
cd example
docker-compose up -d
```

Install [EasyInstall](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-EasyInstall) to make your life more easy
